# graded-writing
A web app to help you write using a vocabulary limited to the most common words

## Purpose
When writing for people who have started learning your language, you want to limit your vocabulary to the most common words. This app connects to a database which stores information about words and their usage statistics. As you type, it provides feedback, colouring your words according to how well they fit into the target that you have set for this particular piece.

## Lemmas and inflexion
A single word may have many inflexions: it may be conjugated (do, doing, done, did) or declined (we, us, our). Some common words may have some less common inflexions (who > whom). The uninflected "base" word (to do, we, who) is called the lemma. You can choose whether to limit your writing only to the most common inflexions, whether to allow only the more common inflexions of a lemma, or to allow all inflexions.

## Setting your target
When you start writing a new piece, you can set
- A target, such as "the [1000] most common [inflexions]" or "the [500] most common [lemmas]"
- The type of target (common inflexions, common inflexions of common lemmas, all inflexions of common lemmas)
- A contingency for words that fall outside the target range (such as the names of characters, or the name of an object that features prominently in the story.

## Feedback as you write
Words that are within your target range will be shown in black. Words that are significantly outside the target range will appear in red. Words that are not too far outside the range will appear in a shade of red that is proportional to their distance from the target.

Two scrollable lists of words are provided for reference:
- An alphabetical list of all words within the target range
- A frequency-ordered list of all words/lemmas in the database

The frequency-ordered list will scroll automatically to display the word closest to the text insertion point. This means that, as you finish typing a word, you can see immediately how frequently it is used in the reference corpus.

## Annotations and illustrations
When you are telling a story, you can use pictures to supplement the text. Pictures allow you to "say" things that are more complex than a limited vocabulary allows. You can include annotations [inside square brackets]. The words inside square brackets will not be coloured. You can use this feature to provide information to an artist about the illustrations you would like to see. You can also provide URLs to images you consider suitable or relevant.
